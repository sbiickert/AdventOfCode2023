 Code solutions for the 2023 Advent of Code

## Starting Off

This year's AoC has started off with a stumble. I had thought I was prepared because I'd updated my support libraries in Perl, PHP and Python (for variety) and I even had a Swift project ready for visualization. I'd written unit test cases for all of them. But then on Black Friday I bought an iPad Pro and I decided my challenge for this year was to use Swift Playgrounds. I quickly refactored and wrote unit tests for my Swift libraries, and adapted my SwiftUI running app to work on the iPad.

But then I was hung over from the Xmas party on Nov. 30th, and I had to travel to help move my Dad into a care home on Dec. 1. Plus, Day 1 was much trickier to solve than a normal Day 1. I was hoping to ease into the new environment and updated language (Swift now has full support for Regex) but it didn't turn out that way. I was tempted to chuck it and go with Perl, but I had to choose whether or not to take my MacBook on the trip or my iPad. I chose the iPad and that forced me to stick with Playgrounds. It got better, and now I've got eight stars.
